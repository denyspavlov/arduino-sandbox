# OLED

Extension of Simple OLED example, which did NOT WORK unfortunatelly.

The adepter idea was worth a try, however when instance of the adapter is 
provided as parameter to Adafruit library it does not work. Interestigly 
enough the I2C discovery DOES work (the scanner function). Which leads me 
to a conclusion that it is something in Adafruit library that is specific 
to the harware Wire implementation.
