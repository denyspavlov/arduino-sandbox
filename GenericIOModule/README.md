# OLED Keyboard

OLED Keyboard is an input device to capture arbitrary input from an input map which is
displayed on OLED. Joystick is used as a "mouse" to navigate to desired character, which
can then be selected using buttons. There are four buttons: BL1 which allows to go into
input mode and confirm input, BL2 to clear current input while in the input mode, BR1 to
select character currently selected via Joystick, BR2 to remove last character (backspace)

This device requires Arduino Mega since anything useful with OLED component needs more 
than 2K RAM (at least 3K)
